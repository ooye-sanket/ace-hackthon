Hey Great People, Welcome to the Community Website Repository ðŸš€

### Overview

- Middleware and API Utilities are written using [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org)




### Requirements

- [npm](http://npmjs.com)

### Usage

#### Install Dependencies

To install all dependencies, run this command:

```cmd
npm install --save-dev
```

#### Develop

Launch the development server with the hot reloading functionality that allows any change in files to be immediately visible in the browser. Use this command:

You can access the live development server at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).

#### Setting up your workspace using GitPod Codespace

In order to prepare and spin up a Gitpod dev environment for our project, we configured our workspace through a [.gitpod.yml](/.gitpod.yml) file..

#### Build

To build a production-ready website, run the following command:

```cmd
npm run build
```

Generated files of the website go to the `.next` folder.
